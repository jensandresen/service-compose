### v0.1.1
Fixed runetime issue when installed as a global module - needed to add the shebang for node in the index.js file.

### v0.1.0
The first release. The PoC has been matured a bit and is ready for a pre-v1 release. The feature set is limited to the basic core functionality of invoking multiple executable on the command line based on configuration from the compose yaml file.
